One section that I would change is the adaptability section. Currently, the max amount of points that you can get for that section is 10 points. I would increase the max amount of points of the adaptability section to either 15 or 20, as a person's adability is extremely integral for successfully integrating into Canada. If an immigrant can easily integrate into Canadian society, then it increases their chances for finding a job, if they haven't already found one. Factors such as previous work experience in Canada, and having relatives living in Canada are especially important for a person's adaptability. For instance, if an immigrant has a relative who lives in Canada, that relative can help them smoothly integrate into Canadian society.
